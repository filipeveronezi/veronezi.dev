I decided to build this blog in order to share my own journey as a web developer and reflect on the importance of developing the **skill of learning**, which I believe is the cornerstone of success in this field. Hopefully in this way I get to rescue somebody that's feeling like giving up - just like I've felt sometimes.

Starting out on the journey of web development can be an **exciting**, but also, **overwhelming** experience. I have learned along the way that the most challenging part of the process is not necessarily understanding the code complexity or some deep abstractions you end up crossing in the way, but the ability to continuously **learn** and **adapt** to new technologies and concepts.

My first try on learning technology was back in 2015. But only 5 years later I fully committed to the path of web development. Looking back, I realized that the years in between were a time of exploration and personal growth, but maybe I could've taken this path much earlier if I had what I consider the right "learning to code" mentality: a programmer is not a robot, a programmer is an inventor.



Being autonomous, never giving up and being open to new ideas and approaches are key aspects that will make you stand out in this ever-evolving field. Technology changes rapidly, so it's important to keep a flexible mindset and not limit yourself to a specific set of tools, languages, or frameworks.

If you forget something. You search for it. The important of the journey for me has been to become a builder, a creator. If you try to memorize stuff just like in high-school, you'll become a robot.
