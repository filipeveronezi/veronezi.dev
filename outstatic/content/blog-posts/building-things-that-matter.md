✨ I've decided to create this blog to share my journey as a web developer. Sometimes *technically*, sometimes *thoughtfully*. Most of the times, *both*.

In the *best case scenario*, I can help somebody who's feeling like giving up - just like I've felt sometimes.

As this is my very first post, I'll introduce myself in a (non-)typical way.

🤓 I'm a *self-taught builder*.

😴 But I once was an *average programmer*.

What does this mean? For me, this was the 🤯 *flip switch* of my carreer.

I'll explain.

I've studied programming for many years (started when I was 15) and I was a *great student* that apparently would become a *great programmer*. But even though my grades were good, I always felt *something was off*. I was trying hard to be a programmer by making (nonsense) software with deep abstractions, complex architechtures and logic. What I didn't realize at that time is I just wasn't *building something*. Something that was *truly useful*.

💡 A programmer doesn't exist to be a logic nerd that creates beautiful code only. A programmer should actually be a *builder*. A builder of software that solves *real life problems* and helps people in the most diversified ways.

Your *framework* of choice doesn't matter that much. Your *language* of choice matters a little more. Your code quality has to be good, though. But it will never be perfect. So what matters the most is…

🔧 *What problems are you solving by building software?*

😁 Let's be driven by that challenge and build *useful* and *enjoyable* software.
